## How to Use This File

1. **Before implementing** - Scan for relevant constraints
2. **When stuck** - Check if we've solved this before
3. **When onboarding** - Read all constraints to avoid common mistakes
4. **Keep updated** - Add new constraints as discovered (with ADR links)

## Adding New Constraints

When adding a constraint:

1. Keep it under 20 words
2. State the rule + the alternative
3. Link to the source of truth (ADR/standard/catalog)
4. Use ⚠️ for "do not do this" and ✅ for "do this"
